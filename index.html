    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a recent graduate with an MSc in Advanced Computer Science with Data Science from the University of Strathclyde, where I completed my degree with Distinction. My academic journey included hands-on work in machine learning, deep learning, and big data technologies, with my dissertation was in computer vision, developing an image similarity based recommendation system using transfer learning and Autoencoders. Before this, I worked as a Business Analytics Associate at Cobot Systems, where I was responsible for automating processes like daily reporting dashboards, Testing and Onboarding using Python, Tableau, and AWS. I also developed and maintained data pipelines to process millions of records efficiently. This experience gave me a solid foundation in end-to-end data workflows, automation, and real-world analytics delivery. My core areas of interest include machine learning, data sciences and engineering, and building systems that use data to solve real-world problems and improve decision-making.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>UK Energy Trends: Real-Time Data Engineering & Fuel Mix Analysis</h3>
      <p>This project explores the UK's electricity generation trends using real-time data from the Carbon Intensity API. It features a complete data pipeline built with Python, Apache Airflow, and SQLite to collect, store, and backfill hourly energy mix data. The project automates ingestion, enables scalable analysis, and uncovers insights on fuel usage patterns by hour, day, season, and fuel type. Through clean visualisations and structured analytics in Jupyter Notebooks, it highlights how the UK balances clean versus fossil energy sources</p>
      <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Apache Airflow, SQLite, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub, Carbon Intensity API </p>

      <h3>Image Similarity Based Recommendation System</h3>
      <p>This project implements a content-based recommendation system that suggests visually similar movies using poster image embeddings. Leveraging the TMDB API, the pipeline extracts movie posters and applies a pre-trained ResNet50 model for deep feature extraction. Autoencoders are then used to reduce dimensionality, optimising for performance without sacrificing accuracy. Cosine similarity metrics drive the recommendation engine, clustering films with related visual aesthetics. The system enhances user experience by enabling discovery of movies based on visual style rather than just metadata or user ratings.</p>
