    <h2>üìÅ Projects</h2>

    <h3>UK Energy Trends: Real-Time Data Engineering & Fuel Mix Analysis</h3>
    <p>This project explores the UK's electricity generation trends using real-time data from the Carbon Intensity API. It features a complete data pipeline built with Python, Apache Airflow, and SQLite to collect, store, and backfill hourly energy mix data. The project automates ingestion, enables scalable analysis, and uncovers insights on fuel usage patterns by hour, day, season, and fuel type. Through clean visualisations and structured analytics in Jupyter Notebooks, it highlights how the UK balances clean versus fossil energy sources.</p>

    <h3>Image Similarity Based Recommendation System</h3>
    <p>This project implements a content-based recommendation system that suggests visually similar movies using poster image embeddings. Leveraging the TMDB API, the pipeline extracts movie posters and applies a pre-trained ResNet50 model for deep feature extraction. Autoencoders are then used to reduce dimensionality, optimising for performance without sacrificing accuracy. Cosine similarity metrics drive the recommendation engine, clustering films with related visual aesthetics. The system enhances user experience by enabling discovery of movies based on visual style rather than just metadata or user ratings.</p>

    <h3>Genre Classification on Spotify Music Data</h3>
    <p>This project focuses on multi-class genre classification using Spotify music data from a Kaggle competition. The dataset includes a rich set of audio features such as tempo, energy, loudness, and danceability. Using Python, the data was explored and visualised through pie charts to identify dominant genres and artists. After preprocessing and handling missing values, several classification algorithms were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Models were evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess performance. This end-to-end project demonstrates practical application of supervised machine learning in the music domain, combining feature engineering, data visualisation, and model evaluation to build a genre prediction pipeline.</p>

    <h3>Goodreads Rating Prediction</h3>
    <p>This project tackles the problem of predicting Goodreads book ratings using a combination of textual and numerical data. Using Python and libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, the workflow involved data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorisation of user reviews, and the integration of features like vote and comment counts. A baseline linear regression model and a custom-built three-layer neural network were trained and evaluated using metrics like mean squared error and mean absolute error. The project demonstrates how natural language processing can be effectively combined with traditional machine learning and deep learning models to predict user-generated ratings, providing a practical application of regression modelling in the context of online book review platforms.</p>
