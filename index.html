                <p> Iâ€™m a recent graduate with an MSc in Advanced Computer Science with Data Science from the University of Strathclyde, where I completed my degree with Distinction. My academic journey included hands-on work in machine learning, deep learning, and big data technologies, with my dissertation in computer vision, developing an image similarity based recommendation system using transfer learning and autoencoders. Previously, I worked as a Business Analytics Associate at Cobot Systems, where I was responsible for automating processes like daily reporting dashboards, testing and onboarding using Python, Tableau, and AWS. I also developed and maintained data pipelines to process millions of records efficiently. This experience gave me a solid foundation in end-to-end data workflows, automation, and real-world analytics delivery. My core areas of interest include machine learning, data sciences and engineering, and building systems that use data to solve real-world problems and improve decision-making. </p>
